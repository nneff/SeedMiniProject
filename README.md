# SeedMiniProject
This project uses a raspberry pi to locate a target in an image, then returns the quadrant of the image that the target was found in.
This data is then sent to an arduino, which is then used to rotate a wheel to a desired location - 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2. 
This repository is used to store and continually update files in real time for use of group members.
